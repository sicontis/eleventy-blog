When I first started using styled-components, it seemed like magic âœ¨.

Somehow, using an obscure half-string-half-function syntax, the tool was able to take some arbitrary CSS and assign it to a React component, bypassing the CSS selectors we've always used.

Like so many devs, I learned how toÂ *use*Â styled-components, but without really understanding what was going on under the hood.

Knowing how it works is helpful. You don't need to understand how cars work in order to drive, but it sure as heck helps when your car breaks down on the side of the road.*

Debugging CSS is hard enough on its own without adding in a layer of tooling magic! By demystifying styled-components, we'll be able to diagnose and fix weird CSS issues with way less frustration.
