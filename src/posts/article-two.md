With the explosive growth and expansion of open-source projects, the project maintainers have to be always on their feet. The longer an open-source project thrives, the more the number of issues and pull requests. And keeping track of new contributions becomes more difficult, which might result in losing out on important bug reports and feature requests. Well, no need to worry, we have bots to our rescue!

Automation could be the key here, bots can assist in welcoming new contributors, informing them of what to expect, where to look for important information, and keeping track of their contributions. Outsourcing this labor to bots can relieve the burden on maintainers, allowing them to devote their time to more important tasks, and also helping to shape better culture and community ambiance around these open-source projects.

Let's dive in and explore some awesome GitHub bots/apps that can ease the maintainers' burden by enabling and empowering them to extend their workflows and customizing the way GitHub functions.
